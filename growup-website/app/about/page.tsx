          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            GrowUp was founded in 2020 by a team of career development professionals who recognized the need for a more
            holistic approach to career services. After years of working in corporate recruitment, career coaching, and
            workforce development, our founders came together with a shared vision: to create a platform that combines
            technology with personalized guidance to help people navigate their career journeys more effectively.
          </p>

            as a leader in career development services, known for our innovative approach and commitment to client
